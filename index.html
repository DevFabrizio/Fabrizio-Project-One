                <h3>strength</h3>
                <p>Strength, in human terms is described in the ability to move the heaviest possible external object. The movement is usually performed against gravity or in other directions through the use of machines or devices. But what is strength exactly? On a physiological level it is comprised of the ability to recruit the highest amount of muscle fibers and to synchronize them together to complete a specific task. It is worth mentioning that strength is task-specific. That means that every movement has to be trained individually</p>

            <div class="hypertrophy-header">
                <h3>hypertrophy</h3>
                <p>Hypertrophy is one of the most sought after goals in every gym. Let's dive into what it really means. Although I previously referred to it as a goal, what hypertrophy really is, is an adaptation. That means that it is achieved through a process. The main drivers of this adaptation are: Mechanical tension, or the amount of resistance out muscles face. Muscle damage, which is a moderate disruptive event that occurs at the fiber level, and Metabolic stress. This last one is the end-state of the sudden influx of ionized molecules that are paramount for muscle contraction.</p>

            <div class="hybrid-header">
                <h3>hybrid approach</h3>
                <p>How do we put all of this together? The requirents for both goals are slightly different but they fuel each other. In physics parameters strength is derived by the cross sectional area of a muscle. Does that mean that the neurological adaptiations we talked about earlier are less important? Actually no! A bigger muscle has the <em>capability</em> of lifting heavier, but it is not guaranteed that it will. the Hybrid Approach describes the process through which by gaining hypertrophy we can subject that muscle to a strength phase where we will adapt and improve our neural drive. This will result in our ultimate achievement of maximizing strength. So to sum it up, the best periodization for both strength and hypertrophy combined is to alternate the two training styles in order to put ourselves in the most favorable position to reach our goals.  </p>
