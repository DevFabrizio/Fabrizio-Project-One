# Fabrizio's Milestone Project 1 

### The Strategy Plane

With this first project I wanted to address a topic that I have been researching on my own in the last years. The topic in question is Sport's Science. In particular my goal was to create a three page website that could serve as a blueprint for the users when they faced situation where they had to make a decision regarding their diet or their time in the weight room. The target audience that I wanted to attract was heterogeneous in nature and it encompassed a wide spectrum of age.

### The Scope Plane

In order to best convey the information within the website I decided to include a simple and visually clear layout and website design. The main features used are a sectioned content divided in two main pages and a third page dedicated to user interaction. 

### The Structure Plane

I wanted to place the information within the website to have a logical order the better suited the message that was on each respective page. To achieve this I used the first page to display the content about resistance training. This prioritization was based on the fact that in a real world application putting the gym first, (in respects to the duality of diet and gym) would yield better results. The second page shows the nutrition related informations, while the third page is reserved to forms.

### The Skeleton Plane

The representation of the various content has been spread over two pages of information and one of interaction to allow the user to completely focus on one topic at a time. I organized the resistance training and nutrition page similarly to create a sense a familiarity which would allow the user to rely on redundancy of visualization to make the UX not overwhelming. I used a fixed navigation bar on top of the page for a quick accessibility to the whole website and a initial hero image and description as a minamalist but inpactful welcome. In the main section of both pages the content is alternated with descriptive or high quality images that assist in relaying the message. The footer section in the three pages is styled with a thought of semplicity and clarity.

### The Surface Plane

The principal choices that characterize the website style are the image used and the colors. In the resistance training page I used a hero image that would maintain semplicity and minimalism while also showing a somewhat aggressive set of colors that would inspire action. The other three images in the page are strongly related to the "content-box" on their side. I did this with a information-reinforcement in mind. For the Nutrition page I used a hero image that would allow the user to immediately understand the type of environment that the page would provide. All the "content-boxes" have effects which enable the user to focus and center the attention on the respective information displayed. I alternated between rounded and sharp corners between images and containers to facilitate readability and give the pages a look that wasn't too rigid.



## The User Story

As previously stated this website is being proposed as a quick access mini-guide to a wide variety of people. The information address a well known need for first time gym goers or all those who intend to embark on a specific type of diet journey. The user would land on the first page that is dedicated to training only. Although this might be confusing for someone who is looking for diet related advice, the evident navigation bar makes it very easy to access the following page. The nutrition content is structured in the second page because within the hierarchy of body recomposition priorities training comes first and it is usually the first topic researched by beginners.
