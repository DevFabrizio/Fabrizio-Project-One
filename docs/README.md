## Introduction

This is my first website for the Code Institute curriculum. Before starting to plan the project, Code Institute suggested various other ideas to work on. Ultimately I have decided to create something from scratch because I wanted to test my creativity applied to coding and how I would have faced the issues that would have risen along the process. This is my final result.

* ### The Strategy Plane

With this first project I wanted to address a topic that I have been researching on my own in the last years. The topic in question is Sport's Science. In particular my goal was to create a three page website that could serve as a blueprint for the users when they faced situation where they had to make a decision regarding their diet or their time in the weight room. The target audience that I wanted to attract was heterogeneous in nature and it encompassed a wide spectrum of age.

* ### The Scope Plane

In order to best convey the information within the website I decided to include a simple and visually clear layout and website design. The main features used are a sectioned content divided in two main pages and a third page dedicated to user interaction. 

* ### The Structure Plane

I wanted to place the information within the website to have a logical order the better suited the message that was on each respective page. To achieve this I used the first page to display the content about resistance training. This prioritization was based on the fact that in a real world application putting the gym first, (in respects to the duality of diet and gym) would yield better results. The second page shows the nutrition related informations, while the third page is reserved to forms.

* ### The Skeleton Plane

The representation of the various content has been spread over two pages of information and one of interaction to allow the user to completely focus on one topic at a time. I organized the resistance training and nutrition page similarly to create a sense a familiarity which would allow the user to rely on redundancy of visualization to make the UX not overwhelming. I used a fixed navigation bar on top of the page for a quick accessibility to the whole website and a initial hero image and description as a minamalist but inpactful welcome. In the main section of both pages the content is alternated with descriptive or high quality images that assist in relaying the message. The footer section in the three pages is styled with a thought of semplicity and clarity.

* ### The Surface Plane

The principal choices that characterize the website style are the image used and the colors. In the resistance training page I used a hero image that would maintain semplicity and minimalism while also showing a somewhat aggressive set of colors that would inspire action. The other three images in the page are strongly related to the "content-box" on their side. I did this with a information-reinforcement in mind. For the Nutrition page I used a hero image that would allow the user to immediately understand the type of environment that the page would provide. All the "content-boxes" have effects which enable the user to focus and center the attention on the respective information displayed. I alternated between rounded and sharp corners between images and containers to facilitate readability and give the pages a look that wasn't too rigid.

## Fonts, Colors and Style Choices

Behind the styling choices there is a very simple reasoning. What I aimed to create was a simple website which would focus more on information and that would cut away most of the unecessary distractions. I chose the headings and paragraphs fonts because they conveyed the message in a modern and readable fashion at different screen sizes. The color palette used is as follows:

## The User Story

As previously stated this website is being proposed as a quick access mini-guide to a wide variety of people. The information address a well known need for first time gym goers or all those who intend to embark on a specific type of diet journey. As a user I would:

* land on the first page
* read the intro of the training section
* search for reliable information through the "strength" and "hypertrophy" sections
* understand what the best method for both would be on the "hybrid approach" section
* connect with the social media of the website through the links in the footer
* move to the second page to learn more about nutrition principles
* read the introduction paragraph
* move to the food pyramid and the deconstruction of the pyramid constituents
* interact with the social media links at the bottom of the page
* open the the third page to access the form section
* fill the first form to share my journey and goals 
* fill the second form to receive the newsletter


# Interactions and Features

## Features Used

I tried to maintain the website in a streamlined look to enhance a direct message and to avoid animations and other interactions that could have distracted the user.

### Navigation Bar
![navigation bar](/assets/img/nav-bar.png)

This navigation bar has been created for immediate use and to remain familiar and of easy access at different screen widths. High contrast and fixed position make this interaction quick and ready at all times.

### Content Features
![introduction and border highlight](/assets/img/intro-and-border.png)

This image shows the introduction section. Placed immediately after the header, provides the information needed to understand the content of the page. The red border and shadow on the bottom of the image is common for all content containers. It transforms red upon hovering and it is designed to focus the user on the selected element.


### Footer Links
![social media links](/assets/img/social-media-bar.png)

As a commonality among many website, the social media links are placed, well identified and visible, at the bottom of the page. The reason for this is obviously to take advantage of most common practices shared by most modern layouts and web pages.

# Testing and Technologies

## Tech Used

The two main technologies used in this project are HTML5 and CSS. Alongside I have used other tools that I have implemented in my process. The website was built using the following technologies:

[Coolors for the color palette](https://coolors.co/)

[CloudConvert to change the file format of the images](https://cloudconvert.com/)

[GitPod as the main text editor and IDE](https://gitpod.io/)

[GitHub as the repository base and to deploy the finished website](https://github.com/)

[Google Fonts as a source for the fonts I used](https://fonts.google.com/?hl=it)

## Bugs

During the process for the creation of this website I've had to correct several bugs. The vast majority of these bugs were in the media queries and in the responsive related code in the css file. For the most part I was able to solve the problem through the correction of some value that displayed in a fixed format, like pixels. By switching to a more adaptive value like percentages or viewport width I was able to restore the responsiveness for the various screen widths.

## HTML and CSS Validation

The HTML and CSS files have all been validated with the W3C Validator:

* [index.html](/assets/img/index-validated.png)

* [nutrition.html](/assets/img/nutrition-validated.png)

* [form.html](/assets/img/form-validated.png)

* [style.css](/assets/img/style-validated.png)

# Deployement and Updates

## Deployement Steps

I have used the GitHub Pages option for the deployement of this website. In particular I followed these steps:
1. Open my GitHub repository for this project.
2. Click on Settings and scroll down until I found the Pages function on the left side bar.
3. I looked for the Build and Deployement voice and saved after selecting Main and Root.
4. Headed over to the Actions page from the main navigation bar to monitor the deployement.
5. Once completed I linked the page URL to this README file.

## Future Development

For obvious reasons a three page website about sport's science is not an exhaustive source of information. The implementation for this project will surely have to be made on the content. A further breakdown of the concepts is needed, as well as in-depth look into the single topics that would arise. With the addition of more information I would advice an improvement of the navigation options to allow the user for a much easier search within the website's pages. In light of the recent progress in machine learning and A.I. it would be wise to implement free tools for calorie tracking and customizable templates for training plans. These updates would certainly drive the user to a much higher number of interactions and a longer engagement time on the website. On a more practical note it is worthy for any future updates of the website to leave a short and useful list on how to address the code. This way the next developer will have a facilitated path on how to recognize the essentials parts of the code.

1. For any HTML file work
* The layout of the structure follows the principles of good and validated semantic code.
* The main content to update is always in the respective "containers" as to make it easier to modify.
* Any change in the social media links or the header and navigation can be easily made by addressing respectively the footer or the top of every html document.

2. Regarding the CSS file
* The style sheet applies the rules in order from the index.html page to form.html page
* The media queries follow the same order and are organized from the biggest screen size to the smallest
