            <h3>the food pyramid</h3>
            <p>What is the food pyramid? It is a concept elaborated to prioritize food groups and to allow the average citizen to make sound decisions when grocery shopping or dining at a restaurant. The pyramid is obviously divided in sections that display the food category and, depending on which level the category is placed, the amount of said food that is wise to consume. This gives a easy-to-use template to determine how a balanced diet should be put into place.</p>

            <h3>the pyramid blocks breakdown</h3>
            <p>Calories: these are the most fundamental block because the represent the base on which energy stands on. The amount of calories you consume will determine wheter you lose, gain or maintain weight. <br>
            Macronutrient: they can be divided into carbohydrates, proteins and fats. When deciding how to assimilate these it is important to note that whole food sources are always the better alternative. <br>
            Micronutrient: present in basically every food source available they are essential for the correct functioning of our metabolism. Although it is possible to assimilate them from supplements it is strongly suggested to do it through vegetables and fruit. <br>
            Meal timing: the general advice here is to find a meal frequency that will suit our goals and daily life best. This will increase adherence to our plan. It is also suggested to consume balanced meals and avoid binge-eating episodes. <br>
            Supplementation: for some individuals the occasion may occure where they need to modify the macro and micronutrient assumption in order to accomodate specific needs. This is one of the few cases where, outside the scope of medical necessities, supplements can be integrated in out diet.</p>
