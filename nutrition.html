                <h3>the food pyramid</h3>
                <p>What is the food pyramid? It is a concept elaborated to prioritize food groups and to allow the average citizen to make sound decisions when grocery shopping or dining at a restaurant. The pyramid is obviously divided in sections that display the food category and, depending on which level the category is placed, the amount of said food is wise to consume. This gives a easy-to-use template to determine how a balanced diet should be put into place.</p>
